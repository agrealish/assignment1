# Ashley Bio

## General Information

My name is Ashley Grealish and I began the post-bacc Computer Science program at Oregon State University in January of 2014. My prior bachelor's degree is in Mathematics, and I also have a master's degree in Finance.  From these degrees I received some experience in Computer Programming and developed an interest in it, so I decided to pursue my Computer Science degree.

I live in Oregon and have lived in Oregon for most of my life.  My degrees were both completed outside of Oregon, so the Computer Science degree I am currently pursuing will be my only degree completed at an Oregon university.

## Hobbies

Of course, I enjoy programming, but I have also been traveling a lot lately with an emphasis in going to the national parks in the U.S.  I love reading and writing, but do not currently have a lot of time to devote to these.

## Interests

My interests lie in traveling, technology, animation, books, and movies.

# Programming Background

Previous Experience: Prior to beginning the post-bacc Computer Science Program at OSU, I did some work in VBA for Excel.  Essentially I created macros for other people in order to make their tasks in Excel more efficient.

Degree Experience: My favorite program I have created in this degree so far was created in C++ during CS 162.  It was a fantasy combat game in which we created different characters and had them battle each other.
I did enjoy the Assembly class, however, as it allowed me a lot of control on the programs we developed, even if the programs took a lot longer to create than those done in C++.
