# Ashley Bio

## General Information

My name is Ashley Grealish and I began the post-bacc Computer Science program at Oregon State University in January of 2014. My prior bachelor's degree is in Mathematics, and I also have a master's degree in Finance.  From these degrees I received some experience in Computer Programming and developed an interest in it, so I decided to pursue my Computer Science degree.

## Hobbies

Of course, I enjoy programming, but I have also been traveling a lot lately with an emphasis in going to the national parks in the U.S.  I love reading and writing, but do not currently have a lot of time to devote to these.

# Programming Background

Previous Experience: Prior to beginning the post-bacc Computer Science Program at OSU, I did some work in VBA for Excel.  Essentially I created macros for other people in order to make their tasks in Excel more efficient.
